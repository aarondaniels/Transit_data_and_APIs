# Apache Maven

Apache Maven is a powerful project management tool used by Java developers. Maven helps organize projects built using centralized software. Focusing on how a project is built and its dependencies allows for more modularity and, thus, easier fixes.

To do this, Maven generates a Project Object Model (POM) file for each project that allows dependencies to be stored in one place. Then, Maven has access to download dependencies and plug-ins dynamically for the best efficiency.

This project will leverage Java to insert records and read data from a MongoDB database. Maven is used to execute the Java code to perform CRUD oeprations on the MongoDB database.
